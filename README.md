This project is based on a Sankyo projector and small web type camera.  
Parts:  
Sankyo1000 projector  
The camera used is the usb web type camera custom designed specifically for this application.  
It has 1920x1080 resolution and it is capable of real time transfer.  
Light  
LED light with the diffuser for even light distribution over the entire frame.
Here is the super 8 test video clip scanned at 15 FPS:

Select Camera Control tab.  
Here you can change to auto or manual exposure.  
Manual exposure is recommended.  
It is to be noted that this screen can be envoked at any time during capture by pressing up arrow on the keyboard.

Adjust focus by sliding the camera in and out of the projector lens mount barrel.  
Pull out on the focus adjust knob to release the tension on the camera mount.  
This will make the adjustment easier to do.

Adjust the projector height by turning the projector height adjustment screw in and out to center the frame height in the   
capture window. The projector height when adjustedd properly will make the projector weight push down onto the camera bottom post  
so that the captured frame is right in the center of the capture window.

The capture process will start.
Adjust the speed by turning the speed d knob past the midd point roughly pointing to the center of the "FAST" label.
If there is some flicker present then turn the speed up or down slightly until you get zero flicker.  
Note that it some cases the flicker cannot be completely eliminated if the exposure is set too low.  
In that case hit the Up arrow key and in the camera tab tweak the exposure higher and readjust the speed.  
A fast way of changing the exposure can be achieved by clicking onto the exposure slider.  
The slider will bee highlighted. Now just use the left and right arrow keys.  
Once done  with the  film, click OK on the exposure window.  
The window will close.  
Stop the capture by clicking on the stop  pulldown.

Turn the projector and light off.  
Now you can precede with output video edit.  
The video can be viewed as is, but some post processing could make the viewing
experience more pleasant.
Here are a few recommendations:
-  Flip the video horizontally.
-  Crop
-  Frame interpolation will make panning much smoother.

## Postproceessing
Avisynth can be used for some postporcessig.  Get Avisynth from:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/avisynth2/
For help with Avisynth refer to:  
http://avisynth.nl/index.php/Main_Page  
Avisynth does not run as a standalone application. It is a tool that allows video editors and viewers to run the script.
The script is essentially a text file that contains avisynth commands for video processing.
One video tool that is very handy for video processing is called VirtualDub.
In addition to basic video processing, VirtialDub reads the avisynth script as well.
Download VirtualDub from here:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/vdfiltermod/files/  
A few useful scripts will be added here in the neext rev of this doc.

## Projector Mods
The projector lamp was replaced with the LED light. 
A custom mount was added so that the light fits nicely in the lamp compartment. 
A custom comact camera was used with a custom mount adapter.  
A single high quality custom designed lens was utilized which providddes very sharp image   
accross  the whole frame and very pleasant colors.
